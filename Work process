1. The program declares several variables:
 • email: a character array of size 100 to store the email address entered by the user.
 • length: an integer to store the length of the email address.
 • i: an integer used for looping through the email address.
 • at_position: an integer to store the position of the '@' symbol in the email address.
 • dot_position: an integer to store the position of the '.' symbol in the email address.

2. The program prompts the user to enter an email address using the printf function and reads in the input using the scanf function. 
   The %s format specifier is used to read in a string of characters, which is stored in the email array.

3. The program calculates the length of the email address using the strlen function. 
   The strlen function takes a string as input and returns the length of the string as an integer.

4. The program loops through each character in the email address using a for loop. 
The loop starts at i=0 and continues until i is equal to the length of the email address. 
The if statements inside the loop check if the current character is an '@' symbol or a '.' symbol, and if so, store its position in the at_position or dot_position variable, respectively.

5. After the loop completes, the program checks if both the '@' and '.' symbols were found, and if so, whether they appear in the correct order and with at least one character in between them. 
Specifically, the program checks that:
 • at_position is greater than 0, meaning that the '@' symbol appears at least once in the email address
